For purposes of this test
<a href="../../../lib/edgartaxonomies.xml">edgartaxonomies.xml</a> is the ONLY
authoritative source of "standard taxonomies". This test checks the allowed files in groups
according to family and version (i.e., release).
</p>
<p>REMARK: This test leaves out USFRTF and ICI given that none of the other EDGAR validations
apply to them.</p>
<p>REMARK:  the following URL's were  added to the 18.1 edgartaxonomies.xml file, along with their http: equivalents.      
This is because they are the latest version of each taxonomy prior to 2018, and there should be no reason for
some references in a given filing to be http and others https.

<td valign="top"><p>REMARK: There is no such section 6.22.3, these tests were originally meant only to verify

that 2008 taxonomies work together but do not work with the 2009 or subsequent

taxonomies because of the XBRL 2.1 level conflict between roleType declarations (when

their allowed linkbases are included in the mix). Eventually, taxonomies of different

vintages are expected to coexist in a DTS without XBRL-level errors and this testcase

will not be necessary. In the meantime and until further notice, other filing

considerations mean that some taxonomies remain incompatible as listed below. Linkbase

versions are only relevant insofar as there are schemas that would appear in the DTS as

a consequence of processing that linkbase. </p></td>
