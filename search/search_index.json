Note: Brel does not contain any filings. You will have to download them yourself. You can find some example filings here . The following steps are required to download a filing and load it into Brel: Search for the filing on the SEC website. Under the \"10-K (Annual Report) and 10-Q (Quarterly Report)\" click on the \"Filing\" button. In the \"Data Files\" section, download all the \".xsd\" and \".xml\" files and place them in a folder (e.g. \"path/to/filing\"). Start python and import Brel. Load the filing using Filing.open(\"path/to/filing\") . Example 1: Loading a filing and printing its facts from brel import Filing, pprint # Load a filing from a file. In this case, the file is called \"filing.xml\". filing = Filing.from_file(\"path/to/filing.xml\") # Get all the facts in the filing. Take the first 10 facts. facts = filing.get_all_facts() first_10_facts = facts[:10] # Print the facts. pprint(first_10_facts) Example 2: Loading a filing and printing its facts where the concept is \"us-gaap:Assets\" from brel import Filing, pprint # Load a filing from a file. In this case, the file is called \"filing.xml\". filing = Filing.from_file(\"path/to/filing.xml\") # Get the concept \"us-gaap:Assets\". assets_concept = filing.get_concept(\"us-gaap:Assets\") # Get all the facts in the filing where the concept is \"us-gaap:Assets\". assets_facts = filing.get_facts_by_concept(assets_concept) # Print the facts. pprint(assets_facts) Example 3: Loading the cover page of a filing and printing its presentation network from brel import Filing, pprint # Load a filing from a file. In this case, the file is called \"filing.zip\". # Note that the zip file contains the filing's instance as well as its linkbases. filing = Filing.from_zip(\"path/to/filing.zip\") # Get the cover page component. cover_page_uri = \"http://www.mycompany.com/roles/coverpage\" cover_page_component = filing.get_component(cover_page_uri) if cover_page_component is None: raise Exception(f\"Could not find component with URI {cover_page_uri}\") # Get the presentation network of the cover page component and print it. presentation_network = cover_page_component.get_presentation_network() if presentation_network is not None: pprint(presentation_network) Additional Examples You can find additional examples in the \"examples\" folder of the repository .
