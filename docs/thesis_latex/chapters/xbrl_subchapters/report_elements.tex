\section{Report Elements}

In the context of XBRL, report elements are the fundamental building blocks that make up the structure of an XBRL report. 
We have already seen the report elements \textit{concepts} and \textit{abstracts} in section \ref{sec:report_elements_motivation}.
To recap, concepts are the elements that facts report against, abstracts are the elements that group concepts and other report elements together.
In total, there are six different report elements that can be used to structure an XBRL report.
These are \textit{concepts}, \textit{abstracts}, \textit{line items}, \textit{dimensions}, \textit{members}, and \textit{hypercubes}.

Since we have already seen concepts and abstracts, we will now look at the remaining four report elements.




% Concepts, abstracts, line items, dimensions, members, and hypercubes provide a comprehensive framework for structuring and organizing data in a way that is consistent and machine-readable.
