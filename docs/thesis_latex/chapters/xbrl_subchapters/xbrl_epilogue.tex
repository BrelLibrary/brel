\section{XBRL Epilogue}

As we have seen in this chapter, XBRL is a complex standard with many moving parts.
It is a standard that has been in development for over 20 years, and it shows.

In the first half of this chapter, we have seen how an XBRL report is, at its core, just a collection of facts.
The second half of this chapter has shown us how these facts can be structured into networks, roles and hypercubes.
This chapter was in no way exhaustive, and there are many more aspects of XBRL that we have not covered.
However, the aspects that we have covered are the ones that are most relevant to this thesis.
The chapter was also, as mentioned in the introduction, 
heavily based on both the XBRL standard\cite{xbrl} created by Charles Hoffman and 
Dr. Ghislain Fourny's interpretation of it in \textit{the XBRL Book}\cite{fourny2023xbrl}.

The next chapter will introduce the API of Brel, and how it interprets the XBRL standard.
The API chapter precedes the implementation chapter, which will explain how Brel implements the XBRL standard.
Even though the API is part of the result of this thesis, it makes more sense to introduce the API before its implementation.
