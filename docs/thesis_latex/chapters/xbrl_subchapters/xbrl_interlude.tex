\section{Segway to advanced XBRL}

This concludes our overview of QNames as well as the overview of the core concepts of XBRL.
Armed with this knowledge, we could already create funcional XBRL reports, albeit with a lot of limitations.

The most glaring limitation is that the facts in the report are not structured in any way.
They are just a bunch of facts that are not related to each other.
Since facts are not related to each other, it is impossible to verify if the values within the report are consistent.

Besides that, XBRL in its current form is not very user-friendly.
The concepts for example are named using QNames, which are not very user-friendly to read.
Another limitation is that they are mostly in English, which makes it hard for non-English speakers to understand the report.

All of these issues will be addressed in the next sections, which will introduce the advanced concepts of XBRL, 
the most important of which are networks.
