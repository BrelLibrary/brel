\section{Overview}

The content of this thesis is largely based on the XBRL standard\cite{xbrl} created by Charles Hoffman and Dr. Ghislain Fourny's interpretation of it in \textit{the XBRL Book}\cite{fourny2023xbrl}.
Since this thesis builds on the foundation laid by the two, it is important to understand the ground work that they have done.
This chapter will give a brief introduction to XBRL.
Think of it as a crash course in XBRL.

In essence, XBRL is a standardized format for representing reports.
XBRL is an acronym for eXtensible Business Reporting Language.

As Ghislain Fourny has put it in \textit{the XBRL Book} \cite{fourny2023xbrl}:
\begin{displayquote}
    If XBRL could be summarized in one single definition, it would be this:
    XBRL is about reporting facts.
\end{displayquote}

Keeping this in mind, this chapter will first introduce the basic concepts of XBRL, namely facts, concepts and QNames.
Then, it will introduce the more advanced concepts that are about putting facts into relation with each other, namely roles, networks, and report elements.

Armed with this fundamental knowledge about XBRL, 
you will then be able to understand how Brel implements the core parts of the XBRL standard and how it hides a lot of the complexity of XBRL behind a simple Python API.

This chapter will not cover the XBRL specification in its entirety.
It will also gloss over a lot of the details of the XBRL specification.
It is more focused on giving the reader a high-level overview of the XBRL specification.

Furthermore, a lot of concepts in XBRL require knowledge of other XBRL concepts.
There are also a few circular dependencies between the concepts, which makes it hard to explain them in a linear fashion.
Therefore, there are a few sections in this chapter that will redefine concepts that have already been introduced.
This is done to gradually introduce the reader to the more complex concepts of XBRL.
