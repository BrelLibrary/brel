This thesis was written as part of my master's degree in computer science at ETH Zurich.
It was supervised by Prof. Gustavo Alonso and Dr. Ghislain Fourny.

Both the thesis and the source code of the library are available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/PapediPoo/Brel}}

The contents of this thesis are based heavily on both the XBRL standard\cite{xbrl} created by Charles Hoffman and "The XBRL Book"\cite{fourny2023xbrl} by Ghislain Fourny.
