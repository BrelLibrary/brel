\section{Preface}

This thesis was written as part of my master's degree in computer science at ETH Zurich.
It was supervised by Prof. Gustavo Alonso and Dr. Ghislain Fourny.

% Both the thesis and the source code of the library are available on GitHub\cite{brel_source}

The contents of this thesis are based heavily on both the XBRL standard\cite{xbrl} created by Charles Hoffman and "The XBRL Book"\cite{fourny2023xbrl} by Ghislain Fourny.
The Brel API as was designed by me with feedback from Ghislain Fourny,
whereas the implementation was done by me alone.
