\section{Robustness}
\label{sec:robustness}

Brel's robustness against real-world XBRL reports is paramount to its usefulness.
Therefore, we will evaluate Brel's robustness by loading the 10K and 10Q reports of the 30 largest US companies by market capitalization at the time of writing
\footnote{Time of writing: 29 January 2024}.
The list of companies that we will use is shown in table \ref{table:companies}.
% This list was generated by using the list of the 100 largest US companies by market capitalization\cite{largest_us_companies} and removing all companies that do not have any 10K or 10Q reports.
This list was generated by cropping the list of the 100 largest US companies by market capitalization\cite{largest_us_companies}.
We limited the list to US companies since the SEC mandates that all US companies must file their financial reports in XBRL\cite{sec_ixbrl}.

\end{table}

The table \ref{table:companies} shows the companies that we will use to evaluate Brel's robustness.
The table shows the largest three companies in the first row from left to right, followed by the next three companies in the second row, and so on.
For all companies, we will use the latest five 10K and 10Q reports that are available on the EDGAR database\cite{sec_edgar}.
We will load the reports using the Brel API and check for one of three outcomes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The report is loaded successfully without any errors.
    \item The report is loaded successfully, but Brel logs a warning or an error.
    \item Brel raises an exception while loading the report.
\end{enumerate}

Since Brel loads reports eagerly, we will only load the reports and not perform any operations on them.
This will give us a good idea of how robust Brel is in practice.
However, it does not cover the full range of Brel's functionality or its correctness.
This functionality was already covered in section \ref{sec:correctness}.
The results of the robustness evaluation are shown in table \ref{table:robustness}.
