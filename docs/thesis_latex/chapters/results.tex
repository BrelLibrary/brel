% After covering XBRL, the Brel API and its implementation, we can now evaluate Brel against the requirements that we defined in section \ref{sec:goals}.
% We will evaluate Brel based on correctness first and performance second.
% This chapter will also cover Brel's robustness and usability in a qualitative manner.

% The usability of Brel will be evaluated by using it to implement a simple CLI XBRL report viewer.
% It will cover every feature of the Brel API and serve as a proof of concept for the Brel API.

% Even though Brel's performance is not part of the requirements set by this thesis,
% it still serves as an important metric.
% It will enable future versions of Brel to compare their performance against this initial version of Brel.

% For testing Brel's correctness, we will use XBRL conformance suites.
% Additionally, we will look at the at a hand-picked XBRL report and compare the structure that Brel extracts
% from it against the results that the XBRL viewer Arelle produces.
% This serves as a qualitative measure of correctness.

% Robustness is a qualitative metric that is hard to measure.
% We will evaluate Brel's robustness by loading the 8K and 10Q reports of the 30 largest US companies by market capitalization at the time of writing.
% This will give us a good idea of how robust Brel is in practice.

Following the discussion on XBRL, the Brel API, and its implementation, 
we are now in a position to assess Brel in light of the objectives outlined in section \ref{sec:goals}. 
The evaluation will prioritize correctness and performance, in that order. 
Additionally, this chapter will qualitatively discuss Brel's robustness and usability.

The usability of Brel will be assessed through the development of a simple CLI tool for viewing XBRL reports. 
This tool will demonstrate the capabilities of the Brel API and act as a practical example of its application.

Although this thesis does not explicitly list Brel's performance as a requirement, 
it remains a crucial aspect of the evaluation. 
Assessing Brel's performance will provide a benchmark for future versions of the software, 
facilitating performance comparisons over time.

The assessment of Brel's correctness will involve the use of XBRL conformance suites. 
Furthermore, we will conduct an analysis of a selected component of an XBRL report, 
comparing the structure Brel extracts with that produced by the XBRL viewer Arelle. 
This comparison will offer a qualitative evaluation of Brel's accuracy.

Robustness, being a qualitative metric, presents challenges in measurement. 
However, by loading the 10K and 10Q reports of the 50 largest US companies by market capitalization as of the date of this analysis, 
we can gain valuable insights into Brel's practical robustness.
