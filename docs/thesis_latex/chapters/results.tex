After covering XBRL, the Brel API and its implementation, we can now evaluate Brel against the requirements that we defined in section \ref{sec:goals}.
We will evaluate Brel based on correctness first and performance second.
This chapter will also cover Brel's robustness and usability in a qualitative manner.

Even though Brel's performance is not part of the requirements set by this thesis,
it still serves as an important metric.
It will enable future versions of Brel to compare their performance against this initial version of Brel.

For testing Brels correctness, we will use XBRL conformance suites.
Additionally, we will look at hand-picked XBRL reports and compare the structures that Brel extracts from them against the structures that the XBRL specification prescribes.

The usability of Brel will be evaluated by using it to implement a simple CLI XBRL report viewer.
It will cover every feature of the Brel API and serve as a proof of concept for the Brel API.

Robustness is a qualitative metric that is hard to measure.
We will evaluate Brel's robustness by loading the 10K and 10Q reports of the 30 largest US companies by market capitalization at the time of writing.
This will give us a good idea of how robust Brel is in practice.
The list of companies that we will use is
