\section{Networks}
\label{sec:api_networks}

Networks are the final piece of the puzzle that makes up the Brel API.
Together with resources and components, they are the parts of XBRL that are not yet covered by the OIM.
Brel aims to give them the same treatment as the OIM parts of XBRL.
This section will describe how Brel represents networks and their nodes.

Essentially, networks are a collection of nodes.
Each node points to either a fact, a resource or a report element.
Nodes can have at most one parent node and an arbitrary number of child nodes.
The whole network can be represented simply by a list of root nodes.
These root have children, which have children, and so on.
Thus, the whole is accessible through the roots.

Like other parts of Brel before them, networks implement a common interface.
This time, there are two interfaces - \texttt{INetwork} and \texttt{INetworkNode}.

\subsection{INetwork and INetworkNode}

The \texttt{INetwork} interface acts as a wrapper around a list of root nodes.
It provides a method for getting all root nodes, called \texttt{get\_roots}.

Besides the list of roots, the \texttt{INetworkNode} also gives access to both the link role and the link name 
of the underlying network with \texttt{get\_link\_role} and \texttt{get\_link\_name}.
These two methods expose the underlying XML structure of XBRL, so why are they part of the Brel API?

The reason is that they are useful for debugging.
Networks are the part of XBRL where filers are most likely to make mistakes.
Both the link role and the link name serve as sanity checks for filers and analysts alike.
They might be removed from the API in the future, but for now they are useful for debugging.

The \texttt{INetworkNode} interface also provides a method for getting all child nodes of a node, called \texttt{get\_children}.
A node can not access its parent node directly, but since the graphs roots are accessible through the \texttt{INetwork} interface,
the parent of a node can be found by traversing the graph from the roots.

These two methods cover all of the functionality that is needed to traverse a network.
The next methods are about getting the elements that a node points to.

Since a node can point to different types of elements, the \texttt{INetworkNode} interface provides the method \texttt{points\_to}.
This method returns a string that indicates the type of element that the node points to.
The possible return values are \texttt{fact}, \texttt{resource} and \texttt{report element}.

The interface also defines the methods \texttt{get\_fact}, \texttt{get\_resource} and \texttt{get\_report\_element}, 
which do exactly what their names suggest.
If the node does not point to the requested element, the methods raises an exception.

The final methods of the \texttt{INetworkNode} interface are \texttt{get\_arc\_role} and \texttt{get\_arc\_name}.
Similar to the link role and link name, these methods expose the underlying XML structure of XBRL and are only used for debugging.

\subsection{Network Types}

As described in section \ref{sec:xbrl_networks}, there are six different types of networks in XBRL.
All of them have their own Network- and Node-classes in Brel.
The classes are named after the network type they represent, with the suffix \texttt{Network} or \texttt{NetworkNode}.
The following table shows the different network types and their corresponding classes.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Network types and their corresponding classes}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Network type} & \textbf{Network class} & \textbf{Node class} \\ \hline
        Presentation          & \texttt{PresentationNetwork}          & \texttt{PresentationNetworkNode}          \\ \hline
        Calculation           & \texttt{CalculationNetwork}           & \texttt{CalculationNetworkNode}           \\ \hline
        Definition            & \texttt{DefinitionNetwork}            & \texttt{DefinitionNetworkNode}            \\ \hline
        Label                 & \texttt{LabelNetwork}                 & \texttt{LabelNetworkNode}                 \\ \hline
        Reference             & \texttt{ReferenceNetwork}             & \texttt{ReferenceNetworkNode}             \\ \hline
        Footnote              & \texttt{FootnoteNetwork}              & \texttt{FootnoteNetworkNode}              \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:network_types}
\end{table}

All of these classes implement the \texttt{INetwork} and \texttt{INetworkNode} interfaces without any deviation.
Since the interfaces are so simple, yet gives access to all the information in the network,
there is no need to change them for each network type.
The different semantic meanings of the networks can be expressed as helper function, which this chapter does not cover.
For completeness, the following diagrams show the inheritance structure of the network- and node-classes.

With the network- and node-classes out of the way, Brel has covered all parts of XBRL it has set out to cover.
The thing remaining with regards to the API is to see how the second half of this chapter answers research question \ref{itm:research_question_2}.
