This concludes the implementation chapter.
This chapter covered the implementation of Brel.
It used both chapter \ref{chapter:xbrl} and chapter \ref{chapter:api} and explained how Brel
converts XBRL reports in the XBRL XML syntax python objects that implement the Brel API.
It also explained how Brel answers research question \ref{itm:research_question_3}.
The next chapter will evaluate Brel based both on correctness and performance.
