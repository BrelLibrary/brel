% This concludes the implementation chapter.
% This chapter covered the implementation of Brel.
% It used both chapter \ref{chapter:xbrl} and chapter \ref{chapter:api} and explained how Brel
% converts XBRL reports in the XBRL XML syntax python objects that implement the Brel API.
% It also explained how Brel answers research question \ref{itm:research_question_3}.
% The next chapter will evaluate Brel based both on correctness and performance.

\section{API Summary}

This marks the end of the implementation chapter,  
which focused on the development of Brel.  
Drawing on insights from chapter \ref{chapter:xbrl} and chapter \ref{chapter:api}, it detailed  
how Brel transforms XBRL reports in XBRL XML syntax into Python objects that conform to the Brel API.  
Additionally, it outlined Brel's response to research question \ref{itm:research_question_3}.  
The following chapter will assess Brel, evaluating both its accuracy and performance.
